# Bu-Bu Ba-Ba: Baby Growth Tracker App - Ayush Dhanraj

A React Native application to track a babyâ€™s growth measurements including weight, height, and head circumference. Built with TypeScript, Zustand for state management, and React Navigation.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Screen Navigation**
  - Bottom tab navigation with **Timeline**, **Add Entry**, and **Profile** screens.
  - Dynamic routing depending on whether a baby profile exists.

- **Baby Profile Management**
  - Create, view, and edit baby profiles.
  - Birth date is validated for growth entry purposes.

- **Growth Measurement Tracking**
  - Add, view, edit, and delete growth measurements.
  - Measurements include **weight**, **height**, and **head circumference**.
  - Unit conversion between **kg/lb** and **cm/in**.
  - Validation for:
    - Date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
    - Date not in the future
    - Date not before babyâ€™s birth
    - Positive numeric values for measurements

- **Dynamic Forms**
  - Uses `react-hook-form` with `zod` for type-safe validation.
  - Conditional rendering based on mode:
    - **New Entry**, **View Entry**, **Edit Entry**.
  - Switches for unit selection with automatic conversion.

- **Data Persistence**
  - Async storage for profile and measurements.
  - Automatically loads existing data on app start.
  - Handles missing or future data gracefully.

- **Growth Analysis**
  - Calculates weight percentile using babyâ€™s age in months.
  - Updates measurements dynamically when units are switched.

## Highlights

- **WHO Growth Percentiles**  
  - Used Python Jupyter Notebook to convert Excel percentile data from WHO's website into JSON format for use in the app.

- **Development Environment**  
  - Built and tested on **Pixel 2 emulator, API 33**.

- **Data Handling**  
  - JSON data is integrated into the app for calculating weight percentiles based on age and gender.

- **Platform & Device Optimization**  
  - Ensures correct rendering and performance on Pixel 2 specifications.

## Notes

- A baby profile is required before adding growth measurements. Users are prompted to create one if none exists.
- Supports dynamic unit switching for weight, height, and head circumference, with automatic conversion.
- Robust validation for dates:
  - Must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
  - Cannot be in the future.
  - Cannot be before the babyâ€™s birth date.
- Growth entries can be **added**, **viewed**, **edited**, or **deleted**.
- Weight percentiles are calculated based on the babyâ€™s age in months.
- Designed for smooth UX with conditional rendering depending on entry mode (new, view, edit).
- Data is persisted locally using AsyncStorage and loaded automatically on app start.
- Handles edge cases such as missing or future dates gracefully.

## ðŸš€ Things to Improve

- **Profile Updates Impact**  
  - If the user updates **gender** or **date of birth**, growth percentiles should be recalculated automatically.

- **Graph Enhancements**  
  - Add support for **editing and deleting entries directly from the graph view**.

- **More Growth Indicators**  
  - Currently only **Weight-for-Age** percentiles are implemented.  
  - Future scope: add **Height-for-Age**, **Head Circumference-for-Age**, and **Weight-for-Height** charts.

- **Testing**  
  - Add unit tests for **percentile calculation utility** and other core functions.

- **UI/UX Improvements**  
  - Improve chart legend rendering (separate styles for trendline vs. child points).  
  - Provide smoother animations when switching units or tabs.  

- **Data Export/Backup**  
  - Option to export growth data (CSV/JSON) or sync with cloud storage.
